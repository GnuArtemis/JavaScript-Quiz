# Trivia-Quiz
A website that allows the user to take a quiz and see their score history.  In essense: there is a initial view with an introduction of the website, a question view where there is a presentation of the question and a list of clickable answers, and a "high score" page. Users can access the questions by clicking on a button, move between questions by clicking on one answer, and return to the intro screen upon reaching the high score page.  The high score page can be reached either by answering all the questions, or by running out of time.
